= Selecting a specific JDK on {rhel} non-interactively

If you have multiple JDKs installed using the `yum` package manager on {rhel} you can
non-interactively select a specific JDK, system wide, using the following procedure. This is useful
for administrators who have root privileges on a {rhel} system and need to switch the default Java on
many systems in an automated way.

.Prerequisites

. root privileges on the system.
. xref:proc-rhel-installing-multiple-major-versions.adoc[Have multiple JDKs installed] on your system using the `yum` package manager.
. Know the desired Java major version which should get selected system wide ahead of time.

.Procedure
. Set the `PKG_NAME` variable to the Java version you'd like to switch to. In our example, that's `java-11-openjdk` for Java 11.
  Then switch to the Java selection using the `alternatives --set` command.

# alternatives --set java $JAVA_TO_SELECT

. Verify the selected Java is the desired version
