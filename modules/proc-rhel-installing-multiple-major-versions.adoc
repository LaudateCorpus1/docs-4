= Installing multiple major versions of OpenJDK

If you are running multiple OpenJDK applications that require different JDK versions you might need to install multiple major versions at the same time.

.Prerequisites

* A user with root privileges.

.Procedure

. On the command line, run the following commands to install multiple versions:
+
[source,subs="+quotes"]
----
yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk --enablerepo=_<rhel-rpms>_
yum install java-11-openjdk --enablerepo=_<rhel-rpms>_
----
+
Where _`<rhel-rpms>`_ is `rhel-7-server-rpms` in RHEL 7 and `rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms` in RHEL 8.

// QE Do we need this step? Should it be a note?
//. The repository that provides the OpenJDK version must be enabled.
