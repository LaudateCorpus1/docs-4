[NOTE]
====
To manage different major and minor JDK versions two things must be done.

. Ensure that each major and minor JDK version is installed into its own unique directory.
. Using the JAVA_HOME environment variable to set the PATH dynamically, you need to only update JAVA_HOME
+
If different versions are used odd errors can occur.
