= Updating {prod} for RHEL using an archive

{comp} can be manually installed using an archive. 
This is useful if the Java administrator does not have root privileges on the system.

The recommended approach to update {archive} install of {prod} is to
redirect the generic path symlink of your JRE or JDK to the latest
installed package.

.Prequisites

* Know the generic path pointing to your JDK or JRE installation. For example, `~/jdks/java-11`

.Procedure
. Remove existing *symlink* of the generic path to your JDK or JRE.
+
----
$ rm ~/jdks/java-11
----
+
. Install the latest JDK (or JRE) in your installation location (e.g. `~/jdks`)
  using instructions for xref:proc-rhel-installing-jdk-archive.adoc[JDK] (or xref:proc-rhel-installing-jre-archive.adoc[JRE])
